1. This program will allow user to input a book ISBN. 

2. Using the ISBN as a search parameter, this program will connect to the KEEPA API to retrieve current Amazon price, the 90 day average price, the current Sales Rank, and the 90 day average sales rank on the user input ISBN.

3. The retrieved KEEPA data will be input into a function to determine a "buyback" price for the ISBN. 

4. Based upon the current date of the search, the user will be given a 30 day window for the "buyback" quote to be guaranteed. The quote expiration will be displayed to the user along the returned "buyback" price.
